## Behavioral Setup

### Imaging Box

...

### Recording scripts

We recorded tadpole and frog swimming behavior in round plate dishes distributed in a custom-built infrared recording setup.

All recordings were aquired with custom [OBS Python scripts](https://git.ista.ac.at/iof-group/applications/003445-obspythonexpmetadatarecording) able to automatically trigger OBS to record videos of the set-up scenes of a given duration in a selected time range.

## Lens Correction

In order to remove geometric aberrations, we applied camera callibraton and [lens correcton](./lens_correction/README.md).
